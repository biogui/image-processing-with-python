Hi, I'm [Bio](https://github.com/biogui)!

And this is my fisrt personal project: a simple photo editor involving basic image processing using Python/OpenCV module

Thanks for testing, feedbacks are awesome! Feel free to contact me on telegram [here](https://t.me/gui_bio) :)

## Usage
Get the updated versions of Python and OpenCV module for python, if you don't have it just follow the tutorials linked below:
* [Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
* [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)

After that, clone the repository with:

: `$ git clone https://github.com/biogui/simple-image-editor-with-openCV ImageEditor`

Now, just run the following commands:

: `$ cd ImageEditor`

: `$ python imgEditor.py <file1 name> <file2 name> <file3 name> ...`

There are only three features in the program: resize, apply blur and apply a convolution filter. Just follow the instructions in the program and choose what will be done within that
